# Kubriko
*A 2D game engine based on Compose Multiplatform*

<img src="documentation/images/logo.png" width="128px"  alt="Kubriko logo"/>

This repository contains the source code of the Kotlin Multiplatform library and its plugins / tooling, as well as the Kubriko Showcase application that demonstrates the engine's capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Kubriko is in early stages of development. The API might change and bugs can be present. The documentation and the tutorials are not yet finalized.

## üéÆ Overview
Kubriko aims to offer a lightweight, scalable, and easy-to-use solution for creating simple 2D games for **Android**, **Desktop** (Windows, Linux, macOS), **iOS** and **Web**.
It achieves this goal by exposing a [Composable](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) function that can easily be embedded into [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) projects.

The engine is highly modular, because its core functionality can be extended in a granular fashion using different plugins.
These plugins cover most needs of simple games; from viewport scaling and object management, through persistence, input handling, and audio playback, all the way to shaders and physics simulation.
Kubriko also offers a number of tools, such as a Scene Editor and a Debug Menu, that can be useful during development.

The tech stack is easy to extend by creating custom plugins, and the low-level integration makes it possible to communicate with platform API-s in a straightforward way.

> [!NOTE]
> The Kotlin/Wasm export functionality of Compose Multiplatform is currently in alpha. This also applies to the Web version of games created with Kubriko. Check out [this page](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/blob/main/documentation/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for a complete list of limitations.

## üé® Showcase app
Clone this repository and run the `app` module for the supported targets (Android, Desktop, iOS, Web) to check out what the engine is capable of.

And the best way, of course, is having fun while creating your very own games!

## üèóÔ∏è Project structure
Besides hosting the engine's source code, this repository also serves as the documentation for its feature set. Each top-level folder / module has its own Readme file that contains general information about the relevant piece of functionality:
- [app](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/app) - The menu system for the showcase app. It ties together the modules located in the `examples` folder.
- [documentation](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/documentation) - Contains markdown files with an overview of the Kubriko API.
- [engine](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/engine) - Defines the core components of Kubriko.
- [examples](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/examples) - Contains the implementation modules of the games, demos, and tests from the Showcase app.
- [plugins](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/plugins) - These modules can be used to extend the functionality of Kubriko.
- [tools](https://github.com/pandulapeter/kubriko/tree/main/tools) - Extensions that can be useful during development such as the Scene Editor. 

For more details, read the KDoc comments for the classes and functions that are exposed in the public API.
